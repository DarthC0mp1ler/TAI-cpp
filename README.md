## Languages Recognition using Perceptron Delta Learning algorithm
  Files with text in different languages stored in some directory. 
  There are as many perceptrons as there are languages and each of them is trained using delta learning algorithm and weights of perceptrons are adjust according to frequency of letters that appear in every language excluding special symbols.
  (This progect is implemented as my first gui in cpp using microsoft sample so it looks quite messy.)
  
## Knapsack Problem
  This algorithm shows brute-force implementation of knapsack problem that combines a knapsack from randomly selected dataset from the given data file.
